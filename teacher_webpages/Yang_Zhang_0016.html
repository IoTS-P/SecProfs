From 2017 to 2018, I was a postdoc at CISPA. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of Luxembourg in 2016. I obtained my bachelor (2009) and master (2012) degrees from Shandong University. My research interests lie at the intersection of **privacy** and **machine learning**. Topics can be broadly categorized into two themes. First, I develop machine learning algorithms to quantify and mitigate privacy risks stemming from a variety of human-generated data, such as social network data, biomedical data, and location data. Second, I investigate novel attack surfaces against machine learning algorithms and develop privacy-enhancing techniques to mitigate the discovered risks. Besides, I also work on social network analysis and algorithmic fairness. ---></p><h2 id="research-areas">Research Areas</h2><ul><li>Trustworthy Machine Learning, with a focus on LLMs (Safety, Privacy, and Security)</li><li>Misinformation, Hate Speech, and Memes</li><li>Social Network Analysis</li></ul><p><span style="color:rgb(0, 119, 181)"><b>I’m always looking for motivated students and postdocs to join my group.
