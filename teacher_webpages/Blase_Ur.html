Since January 2017, I have been faculty in the <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago's Department of Computer Science</a>. I started as a Neubauer Family Assistant Professor and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in July 2023. I founded the <a href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu">UChicago SUPERgroup</a>, an interdisciplinary research collective with dozens of incredible members. <a href="pubs.htm">Our research</a> spans <span style="font-weight:bold;">computer security</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">privacy</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold;">human-computer interaction (HCI)</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">ethical AI</span>. We are especially interested in developing data-driven methods for helping users make better security and privacy decisions, as well as making complex computer systems more usable for non-technical users. Our work has been supported by nine NSF grants, as well as grants from Mozilla Research, Meta, Google, and the Data Transparency Lab.<br /><br />

I have been fortunate to receive a <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-announces-2021-winners-quantrell-and-graduate-teaching-awards">Quantrell Award for Undergraduate Teaching</a> (2021), <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2047827">NSF CAREER Award</a> (2021), <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3170427.3185060">SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award</a> (2018), five best/distinguished paper awards (<a href="https://www.blaseur.com/papers/chi24-retrograde.pdf">CHI 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/nisenoff-retrospective">USENIX Security 2023</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3026050">CHI 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/melicher">USENIX Security 2016</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2632048.2632107">UbiComp 2014</a>), five honorable mentions for best paper (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445567">CHI 2021</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445061">CHI 2021</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376415">CHI 2020</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2858036.2858546">CHI 2016</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2207676.2207759">CHI 2012</a>), the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2016">John Karat Usable Privacy and Security Student Research Award</a> (2016), an <a href="https://ndseg.sysplus.com/NDSEG/About/">NDSEG Fellowship</a> (2012), and a <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/europe-and-eurasia/hungary">Fulbright Scholarship</a> (2010). Jointly with the other core members of the CMU passwords group, I also received the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/people/achievements/newell/newellmedal_winners">Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence</a> (2020) and the <a href="https://cybersecurity.ieee.org/blog/2018/10/02/ieee-cybersecurity-award-winners/">IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice</a> (2018). I have strong interests in <a href="teaching.htm">teaching</a> and <a href="outreach.htm">outreach to high school students</a>, particularly for broadening participation in CS.<br /><br />

I earned a PhD in 2016 from Carnegie Mellon University's Societal Computing program, where I was advised by the amazing <a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/">Lorrie Cranor</a>. My dissertation focused on supporting users' password-security decisions with data. Earlier, I earned an AB in computer science from Harvard University and worked for three years at Rutgers University on outreach and diversity programs.<br /><br />

My first name is pronounced "blaze," and my full name is pronounced "blazer." I strongly prefer to be called Blase rather than Professor Ur or Dr. Ur, both of which sound ridiculous. (Note: just Blase, not <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Professor Blase</span> or <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dr. Blase</span>. Also not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEdNAzv1LD8" style="text-decoration: line-through;">BlasÃ©</a>.) I use he/him pronouns; they/them pronouns work just fine, too.<br /><br />
I am also a <a href="music.htm">musician</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/blase/albums/72157622932580779">photographer</a>, and previously a <a href="theater.htm">theatre designer</a>. I ride my bicycle (almost) everywhere, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/blaseur/collection?sort=artist&sort_order=asc&limit=250">collect records</a>, <a href="travel.htm">travel</a>, and drink too much coffee. I'm from somewhere in the swamps of Jersey.
