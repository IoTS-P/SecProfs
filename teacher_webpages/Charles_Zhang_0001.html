My general reseach interest has been to study how to improve the ways we implement and troubleshoot complex software systems using both static and dynamic programm analysis techniques.

<p> 
<b>Replaying concurrent software.</b>Automatic fixing of concurrent bugs. 

Replaying a concurrent execution is highly useful for diagnosing concurrent bugs. We have made a series of contributions in this direction including <i><b>Clap</b></i> (<a href="clap.pdf">PLDI2013 paper</a> and  <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/prism/clap/">Implementation</a>), <i><b>Leap</b></i> (<a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~smhuang/academic/leap.pdf">FSE 2010 paper </a> and <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/prism/leap/">implementation</a>),  <i><b>Stride</b></i> (<a href="stride.pdf">ICSE 2012 paper</a>), and <i><b>Lean</b></i> (<a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~smhuang/academic/lean.pdf">OOPSLA 2012 paper</a>).
<ul>
<li><i><b>Leap</b></i>: an order-based replaying framework that handles large Java concurrent systems with as low as 9% overhead. Details are published in our <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~smhuang/academic/leap.pdf"> FSE 2010 paper </a>. And the replayer itself is <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/prism/leap/">available</a> for the public use. 

<li><i><b>Stride</b></i>: a search-based replaying framework that permits the Concurrent-Read-Exclusively-Write (CREW) execution. The details can be found in our <a href="stride.pdf">ICSE 2012 paper</a>. 

<li><i><b>Lean</b></i>: a technique that addresses the replaying efficiency by automatically removing the redundant logs and guarantees the bug reproducibility. For instance, the "leanified" OpenJMS takes 16 seconds to replay a bug instead of 10 mins. Please read our <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~smhuang/academic/lean.pdf">OOPSLA 2012</a> paper for details. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Automatic fixing of concurrent bugs.</b> We have contributed the following techniques that show great potential in automatically fixing certain category of concurrency bugs: <i><b>Axis</b></i>(<a href="axis.pdf">ICSE2012 paper</a>) and <i><b>Privateer</b></i> (<a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~smhuang/academic/privateer.pdf">OOPSLA 2012 paper</a>).

<ul><li><i><b>Axis</b></i>: a technique that applies control theory to automatically synthesize locks to fix atomicity violations. Results are reported in our <a href="axis.pdf">ICSE2012 paper</a> 

<li><i><b>Privateer</b></i>: a technique safely privatizes accesses to shared variables to fix concurrency bugs without the use of locks and even produces speed-ups for some applications. For details, please read our <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~smhuang/academic/privateer.pdf">OOPSLA 2012</a> paper. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Predicative Bug detection.</b> We work on predictive trace analysis and have built a tool called <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/prism/pecan/">PECAN</a>. Please read our <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~smhuang/academic/pecan.pdf"> ISSTA2011 paper</a> and our TOSEM paper for details.  

<p>
<b>General program analysis techniques.</b> We develop fundamental program analysis techniques as corner stones of software engineering techniques in general. The <i><b>geometric encoding</b></i> is a new way of accelerating the context and the heap-sensitive pointer analysis. Please read our <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~richardxx/papers/geom.pdf">ISSTA 2010 paper </a> for details. PERT is a framework that provides the tailored object persistence behavior according to the program execution context. Please read our <a href="./pert/pert.pdf">TSE paper </a> for details. <p>

<i><b>Mining software artifacts.</b></i> Mining techniques are also useful in revealing insights about the intentions of programmers and in helping writing good quality programs. The  <i><b>G-Finder</b></i> tool combines the source code structure with the hidden social network information inside programming forums to locate question-specific experts. Please read our <a href="academic/gfinder.pdf"> OOPSLA2010 paper </a> for details. Our <a href="academic/mining.pdf"> TSE paper</a> (journal version of the AOSD07 paper) describes a mining technique for automatically finding program features that are not modularized.       </OL--!>    <p>

My general reseach interest centers around the use of both static and dynamic programm analysis techniques for making complex software systems more secure and reliable. <p> 
<b>The 10-million-line static analysis statement</b>: "to achieve all-sensitive precision and sublinear scalability while <b>SIMULTANEOUSLY</b> addressing the <b>CODA</b> requirements : achieve scalability by being continuous both in time, incremental, and in space, accumulative (<b>C</b>ontinuous); be open for defining customized source-code test cases through APIs or DSLs (<b>O</b>pen); respect the fact that source code is largely unavailable(<b>D</b>ark code); understand assembled program dependency (<b>A</b>assembled) introduced by frameworks and middleware.
<p>
Our answer to these challenges is the <a href="https://www.clearblueinnovations.org">Clearblue</a> research project, a database-like software analysis platform. Clearblue analyzes software in its binary form with or without debug symbols, with or without sourcecode. It is capable, currently, of generating precise data flow information for Linux kernel, almost 30M lines of code, in 30 mins and materializes it on disk. Investigation tasks such as bug finding can be coded via the Clearblue API, on average, in 30 mins.
