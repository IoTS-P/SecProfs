	  <div class="body">
 	    <p>I am the Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago. I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer 
Engineering from University of Maryland, College Park in 1999. 
Prior to joining University of Chicago in 2017, I spent 6 years in industry labs (Bell-Labs, NJ 
and Microsoft Research Asia), and 12 years at University of California at Santa Barbara.  At UChicago, I co-direct the <a href="http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/">SAND Lab (Security, Algorithms, Networking and Data)</a> together with Prof. <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben">Ben Y. Zhao</a>. </p><p>


I was selected as one of the MIT Technology Review's <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/10/issue/feature_tr35.asp?p=9">TR 35</a> 
(2005) for my work on Cognitive Radios; my work was featured by MIT Technology Review as one of the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?ch=specialsections&amp;sc=emergingtech&amp;id=16471">10 Emerging Technologies</a> (2006). I am a 
fellow of the <a href="http://www.wtn.net/">World Technology Network</a>, an IEEE Fellow (class'15) and an ACM Fellow (Class'22).  More details in my <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng/Zheng-CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p><p>

I am extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with and continue to work alongside a talented group of <a href="http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/people.html">students</a>. 

I am always looking for talented and self-motivated graduate students on mobile computing/systems, applied 
machine learning, and security and privacy.  Prospective students should email me your resume with a subject 
line of "UChicago PhD Applicant." I am also looking for UChicago undergraduates in these areas (email me 
your resume with a subject line of "UChicago UG Research.")</p><p>

	<b>My Research</b><br>

Over my 20+ years in research labs and academia, my research has evolved and adapted to target important 
high impact research problems that match my interests and research background. I subscribe 
to the practice of focusing on innovative ideas and maximizing impact over incrementalism. In the past, 
this has covered significant ground in wireless networking, mobile systems, network measurements and 
security. </p><p>

Most recently, I am focusing my attention on three broad areas: <br>
 1) mobile/IoT/VR sensing and its 
implications on security and privacy (what does the increasing ubiquity 
of sensors for RF, video, and audio mean for personal privacy and 
security); check out <a href="http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/jammer/">bracelet-of-silence</a>, <a href="http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/electricauth/">EMS-based-authentication</a>, <a href="http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/adversarialwifi/">WiFi-reconnaissance</a>, <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/">Fawkes</a>, <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/keystroke/">single-camera-keystroke-inferece-attack</a>, <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/vrkeystroke/">VR-keystroke-inference-attack</a>; <br>
 2) security &amp; privacy of deep learning systems (how 
can we design and train deep neural networks to improve security for computer systems while remaining 
robust against a wide range of powerful adversarial attacks); some recent works include  <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/blacklight-usenix22.pdf">Blacklight</a> for black-box query attack detection, and forensic tools to protect ML models post-deployment (<a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/forensics-usenix22.pdf">PoisonForensics</a>, <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/pdf/salt-ccs22.pdf">Post-Breach-Recovery</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09574"> ModelVersioning</a>);  <br>
3)  copyright protection and fake content detection wrt generative AI systems;  some recent works include <a href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/">Glaze</a>, <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/"> NightShade</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03214">GenAIdetector</a>. 


<!--
My research style is interdisciplinary, often combining strengths and novel concepts of systems and networking, economics, and data analytics. Recently, I am devoted to applying measurements and data analytics to discover and understand the fundamental structures underlying various social, mobile networks and medical systems, the processes and user behaviors that drive dynamics in these networks, as well as potential vulnerability to attacks and privacy leaks. I am also exploring the use of machine learning in the areas of mobile computing, networking and systems design.
