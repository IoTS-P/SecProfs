<font size="+1"> <b> Brief Bio: <br> </b>
Gene Tsudik is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  
He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from USC in 1991. Before coming to UCI in 2000, he was at IBM Zurich 
Research Laboratory  (1991-1996) and USC/ISI (1996-2000). His research interests include many topics in 
security, privacy and applied cryptography. Notably, these do not include Machine Learning, 
Differential Privacy as well as Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies. 

Gene Tsudik was a Fulbright Scholar (Italy) and a 3-time Fulbright Specialist (Singapore, Taiwan, and Myanmar). 
He is a fellow of ACM, IEEE, AAAS, and IFIP,
as well as a foreign member of Academia Europaea.  From 2009 to 2015 he served as Editor-in-Chief of 
ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (TOPS, formerly known as TISSEC). He was the recipient of 
the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Outstanding Contribution Award, 
the 2020 IFIP Jean-Claude Laprie Award. 
the 2023 ACM SIGSAC Outstanding Innovation Award, 
the 2024 NDSS Test-of-Time Award, 
and a 2024 Guggenheim Fellowship.
He also authored the first rhyming crypto-poem published as a refereed paper. 
Sadly, he has no social media presence.

<font size="+1"> <b> Diversity uber alles! </b> 
Modern diversity dimensions are notoriusly inadequate in capturing
all important aspects of variety in the homo sapiens species. For example, consider the following:
    <ul style="font-family: tahoma;">
<font size="-1">
<li> Vertical dimension: both dwarves/midgets and giants (use your own measures to define them) represent a 
non-negligible fraction of human population. Yet, their representation in academia is dismal.  
<li> Gravitational dimension: nearly 40% of US population is obese. Where are they in academia? Why do academic
search ads fail to entice this hefty fraction of humanity?
<<li> Intellectual dimension: between 20 and 40% of US population has under-100 IQ. While some academic departments
and disciplines are over-filled with them, representation in others remains dismal. How would students with similar 
IQs learn when their instructors do not present adequate role models?
</ul>

<font size="+1"> <b> There are two equivalence classes of idiots: </b>
<ul style="font-family: tahoma;">
<font size="-1">
  <li> Those who yearn for the past that never was.
  <br> AND
  <li> Those who dream of the future that never will be.
</ul>

<br>

<font size="+1"> <b> Quotidian Wisdom (speaking of idiots): </b>
<ul style="font-family: tahoma;">
<font size="-1">
  <li>  For every pithy inspirational quote, saying or proverb, there is army of idiiots willing to believe it.
 </ul>

<font size="+1"> <b> An urgent message to all humorless barbarians inhabiting this long-suffering planet: </b>
<ul style="font-family: tahoma;">
<font size="-1">
  <li> As a free human being, I reserve the right to disrespect, mock, parody, laugh at,
and disbelieve  any 
  and all of your deities, saints, prophets, idols, holy fools, deans, chancellors, political leaders, gurus, kings, presidents and presidential candidates.
