 	    <p>I am a Neubauer Professor of Computer Science at University of Chicago. Over the years, I've 
	    worked on a number of areas from <I>P2P networks, online social networks, cognitive radios/dynamic 
	    spectrum, graph mining and modeling, user behavior analysis</I>. Since 2016, I've focused on 
	    security and privacy in machine learning and wearable systems. Since 2022, I work primarily on 
	    adversarial machine learning and tools to mitigate harms of generative AI models against human 
	    creatives in different industries. My primary research venues are CCS/Oakland/USENIX Security. In 
	    the past, my broad interests led me to publish at a range of top conferences, including 
	    NeurIPS/CVPR, IMC/WWW, CHI/CSCW, and SIGCOMM/NSDI/Mobicom. Here's a wordle of paper abstracts around

<P>I am Director of Graduate Studies at UChicago Computer Science. For DGS related questions, please email me at "dgs at cs dot uchicago dot edu".

	    <p>Together with Prof. <A HREF="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng">Heather Zheng</A>, I co-direct the <A HREF="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu">SAND 
	    Lab</A> (Security, Algorithms, Networking and Data) at University of Chicago.
	I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley
	in 2004, where I was advised by
        <A HREF="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/">John Kubiatowicz</a> 
        and <A HREF="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~adj">Anthony Joseph</a>, and
	created the Tapestry distributed hash table (<a href="https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/publications/dissertation">dissertation</a>). I received
	my MS from Berkeley in 2000, and my BS in computer science from Yale
	in 1997.  I am an ACM Fellow (2021), a recipient of the NSF
	CAREER award (2005), USENIX Internet Defense Prize (2023), TIME Magazine AI100 (2024), MIT Tech Review's TR-35 Award (Young Innovators Under
	35) (2006), IEEE Internet Technical Committee's Early Career Award (2014), and one 
        of ComputerWorld's Top 40 Technology Innovators
	under 40. Back when my kids were small and I had "free time,"
	I wrote about research and PhD life on <A HREF="https://www.quora.com/profile/Ben-Y-Zhao">Quora</A>.

	   CMSC 14400-2 (Systems Programming II), M/W 10:30-11:20AM, Ryerson 251</I><BR> 

This course is a continuation of 14300, and covers the basics of computer systems from a programmerâs 
perspective. Topics include machine language programming, exceptions, code optimization, performance 
measurement, system-level I/O, and concurrency. Students will gain further fluency with debugging tools and 
build systems.

<B>Spring 2024:</B> Time/location TBD, <I><A HREF="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/classes/301/">CS30100 (Technical Writing and Presentations)</A></I><BR>
Clear, logical writing and presentations are foundational skills for 
computer scientists. This class is meant to introduce computer science 
students to basic ideas and techniques for effective communication in 
both writing and presentations. The class will include several 
complementary components, including critical analysis of technical 
papers, weekly writing assignments focusing on writing style, clarity, 
and logical flow, and discussions of style for different research areas 
and venues. The course is primarily targeted towards graduates 
students, although undergraduates can audit the class (or enroll with 
permission from the instructor). No prerequisites.

<b>Fall 2022:</B> Tu/Th 2PM-3:20PM, Ryerson 255, CS333 Graduate Computer Networking</I><BR> (Prereq: CMSC 233). 
	This is a course on computer networking specifically 
	designed for graduate students. The course focuses heavily on research
	methods, and readings focus on technical publications. Undergraduates 
	interested in learning about networking should only take CS333 if 
	they have already completed CS233 or similar as a prerequisite.

	<b>Spring 2022:</B> Tu/Th 11am-12:20PM,  <I>CS35401: Ethics and Misuse in Machine Learning Systems</I>, Ryerson 277<BR>
	This is a seminar focusing on reading and discussing current research on the ethics and misuse/abuse of machine learning systems. 
	Each student will lead a discussion for two to three papers over the quarter.

	<B>Spring 2020:</B> Tu/Th 12:30-1:50PM, Zoom, <A HREF="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/classes/35401/">CS35401-2: Topics Seminar - Adversarial Machine Learning</A><BR>
	Reading seminar on adversarial machine learning, primarily designed for PhD and MS students interested 
	on research in this space. We will meet twice a week, and students will lead discussions on papers ranging
	from adversarial examples to poison, black-box, surrogate model attacks. We can cover both empirical papers
	from the security community as well as those from core ML conferences.

	    <p><strong>I'm always looking for bright PhD students!!</strong><br />
I'm always interested in self-driven/passionate students who want to work on high impact projects and have fun doing it.  
UChicago is a fantastic place to do a PhD, and we're constantly making 
improvements to the lab and the department. To find out a bit more about me as an advisor, and my 
views on everything from students to research and the meaning of life, you can read some of my posts on 
<A HREF="https://www.quora.com/profile/Ben-Y-Zhao">Quora</A>, where I've been "Top 
Writer" since 2014.

<!-- To get on a short list of names Heather and I will look for when reviewing applications, please fill out a <A HREF="https://forms.gle/aC3JWGZu2m8AMhJg6">basic form</A>. This is better than email.
We have in the past hosted visiting students and postdocs. If you're 
interested in either of these, please email me with your CV and research 
interests/projects.-->
I read all my emails. But due to the volume of emails, I am often
unable to reply to individual emails.

If you are looking for a summer undergraduate internship, please do not email me directly. UChicago CS has 
organized a summer undergraduate internship program with more info <A 
HREF="https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/student-summer-research-fellowship-program/">here</A>. If you 
are a high school student or undergraduate looking for a summer internship related to data, you might be 
interested in the DSI <A HREF="https://cdac.uchicago.edu/engage/student-opportunities/">Data and Computing 
Summer Lab</A>. SAND Lab is involved in both programs, although the number of interns we take each summer can
vary depending on the applicant pool.


	    <p><strong>UChicago Undergraduates interested in research?</strong><br />
	    We generally advise 3-5 undergraduates in my lab in active
	    research (we have 1-2 spots for fall 2024). If you're interested in working in my lab as an 
	    undergrad, drop me an email. Generally speaking, the best way to join my lab
	    as an undergrad is to take
	    and do well in my courses in networking or applied ML.

<!--	    <P><I><B>Note on student advising</B></I><BR>
	Advisors are in positions of power over their graduate students and students are unfortunately not 
	always empowered to speak up when something is not right. I welcome student input, especially if I 
	or one of my colleagues has said or done something that makes a student feel uncomfortable. 
	
	Professors should not behave in ways that are abusive, toxic, disparaging or unwelcomed. 
	Students should not experience any of those behaviors from their advisors, and if they do, though 
	it can be scary, I hope they tell me. Though I cannot promise outcomes, I will be available 
	to listen and try to help.  -->
