<b>Personal.</b> I grew up studying karate (Wado-kai Karate, under Tanabe Sensei) and kendo (Japanese sword fighting, under Iwakabe Sensei). After moving to Seattle, I started switched karate styles (Hayashi-ha Shitoryu Kai Karate, under Minakami O'Sensei) and re-started aikido (Kannagara Aikido, under Barrish Sensei). Today, I manage Hayashi-ha Shitoryu Kai karate in the United States, and I assist as a coach for the UW Aikido Club. I used to teach yoga (power vinyasa). I also enjoy open water swimming, bicycling, and running.

<p><b>Research.</b> I strive to envision what the world might be like the next 5, 10, or 15 years, anticipate what risks and harms might arise (under various possible futures), and then proactively and ethically study those risks+harms and explore mitigations. I am particularly interested in (1) exploring new, previously unexplored technologies and research areas, (2) exploring existing research areas with novel, new approaches, (3) exploring issues of contemporary importance, (4) conducting work that is cross-disciplinary, (5) leveraging the best methodologies to explore the questions at hand (e.g., user studies, Internet crawlers, or experimental attack explorations), and (6) conducting work that is import to society and that recognizes that society and technology are deeply intertwined.

<p>Example technology areas of study include:

	<b>Electronic Voting Security</b>: In 2003, my colleagues and I conducted the <a href="research-pubs.html#diebold" target="_blank">first academic security analysis of real electronic voting machine software</a>. Our work played a pivotal role in the emerging national discussion of electronic voting security. I continued to work in electronic voting security until 2006, including co-chairing the USENIX/ACCURATE Electronic Voting Technology Workshop in 2008. I also testified before the U.S. House of Representatives, on the topic of electronic voting security.

	<b>Remote Physical Device Fingerprinting, Clock Skews, and Side Channels</b>: In 2005, my colleagues and I discovered and studied mechanisms to <a href="research-pubs.html#devfingerprinting" target="_blank">remotely fingerprint physical devices by inferring information about their clock skews</a> from their network packets. I have been told that the credit card industry uses my methods to help detect online credit card fraud.
I continue to be interested in other forms of information leakage and side channels. For example, we studied the ability to <a href="research-pubs.html#tvemi" target="_blank">infer what one is watching on TV by monitoring their powerline</a>. We studied the ability to <a href="research-pubs.html#auto-fingerprint" target="_blank">fingerprint automotive drivers</a> by the ways in which they operated their vehicles.

This work helped initiate the field of medical device security and resulted in significant changes within industry and government.
    The executive producers of Homeland incorporated medical device security into their TV show <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/homeland-brody-kills_n_2213510">after reading about our research</a>. 	
	My subsequent work includes studies with <a href="research-pubs.html#imdvsd" target="_blank">patients</a> and <a href="research-pubs.html#imd-providers" target="_blank">medical providers</a>, and encompasses cardiac devices, insulin pumps and glucose monitors, telerobotic surgery, and brain-machine interface devices. For the latter, we coined the term <a href="research-pubs.html#neuro" target="_blank">neurosecurity</a>. Our vision is outlined in a <a href="research-pubs.html#nejm" target="_blank">2010 New England Journal of Medicine</a> article. We co-founded the USENIX HealthSec conference in 2010. My ongoing work is focused on telerobotic surgery.

Written by a team of world-renowned cryptography experts, this essential guide is the definitive introduction to all major areas of cryptography: message security, key negotiation, and key management.
